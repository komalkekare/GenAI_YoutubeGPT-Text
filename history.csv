It is quite interesting to work in Brilio because of its open working culture, where there is no typical cubicle system and we can openly go and communicate with any of the leaders and share our feedback. Hi, I'm Rahul from the data analytics department. I joined Brilio last week, but my journey began long before last week. Brilio came to my campus, they made me feel really comfortable, they stopped me when I had problems and they didn't make me stress out, which was the best process. Hi, I'm Anusha, I completed my BSA from Mount Carmel College. I have been part of this Brilio family. The trainings which we receive here in prior is very much informative and it will be related to practice. My teams are continuously assisting me and giving me very good training so that I can get into work very well. Hello everyone, I'm Shubhangi Pathro. I'm a PPE trainee at Brilio under the category Java full stack developer. The journey with Brilio started from on-campus placement, which was a beautiful journey where everything was very smooth. We were being assessed on our technical skills as well as a logical ability skill and also our communication which was judged in the interview process. Hi, I'm Dhanush Bekal, senior engineer at Brilio. As a fresher, I couldn't have asked for a better company to kickstart my career. Brilio came to NITK for the second time and the well-structured recruitment process included three rounds of interviews and screening followed by a good news call from the HR. Hello, I'm Ranak Piraka, currently a software engineer at Brilio. When Brilio came to our college for the recruitment process, we had other companies visiting us too. But when I attended the session from Brilio, it helped me out knowing that the company was really established and I was keen to be part of this organization. The fresh and inclusive working culture over here is very inviting and I'm really happy to say that I'm a Brilian. My philosophy is to keep going, keep learning and I think Brilio's philosophy matches with my personality. We were learning, we are learning and we will be learning to make Brilio the best digital company. Getting placed in Brilio via campus placement was the best thing that happened to me. It's just been a week at Brilio and I think I found a perfect match."

development you can show that off in interview but the first round will itself be away and if you're not able to qualify then how are you going to tell the interviewer that i have done this this and i got an on campus placement in the brilliant hi and welcome back to coding ninjas friends i'm kapil singh and i'm here with another spectacular interview experience for you guys there are i have you know somebody who's going to give us a really good insights of a company called brillio so we are going to you know get to know from akshay that how he actually started with his interview and how he ended it with the fourth round i read his article on our website of coding ninjas there were four rounds for brillio where he was you know finally selected so if you also want to read the article i'll be putting the link in the description below you can have a look at the article as well so i would like to welcome akshay and hi akshay how are you doing hi kabir i'm doing fine actually would you mind giving us a small introduction about yourself so that we can start up with the shoot yeah sure kapil so like hi everyone my name is akshay anil and i graduated in this year like 2022 and i got an on campus placement in the brilliant so yes it's been an amazing four-month journey in my first company and there are some talks like if you'll discuss later in this video okay and also apart from that i really like i find a passion in my teaching so i started a youtube channel of my own that's giving some data topics okay moving forward akshay since you have written in the article that you had four different rounds can you tell me what all those rounds were and then we'll start you know kind of discussing every round in brief okay so the first round was like usually when you go the resume screening around so our resume got selected and then actually the first one started within oa which is also an online assessment okay they were like a bunch of aptitude questions if i am not wrong there were like 25 aptitude questions and there were some questions on basic english and reasoning and after that in the same test i had two coding questions and if i remember like one on some variation of hash map and another one was dp in the variation of 0 1 knapsack i have also mentioned these details in the article you can go through that all of these are in the first round of the oa yeah in the first round the aptitude questions and the coding questions great so the second round began and it was like group discussion round since it was the online mode with the covid 19 right so everyone was given an opportunity a topic was thrown at that point and you have to say something about that so there were some talks about that like you start like if you the person you have started the duty then there are absolutely some bonus points right there was a point there also that many of them were not speaking i don't know why so individually our coordinator or say invigilator has given the individual chance to everyone and still i observed that there was some students which are not at all speaking but yeah i started i took some guidance on the cvr and i started that gd i picked the ice so that round got cleared so we had the second round then i got qualified this third round and it was like technical interview uh-huh and since if you're a csd student you know the all the fundamentals we required operating system and of course the coding the dsa right so like my round started with the oops concept like they asked me that what are the four pillars of oops and then went on with dbms they given some joint queries to actually run in the compiler and show the output so after this fundamental round got clear they also asked the question of computer networking i was fortunate that they didn't ask any questions on operating system okay you're not you're not very fond of operating systems if they would have asked i have given the answer that's not an issue but still there's a probability that you can get stuck in some topic just not very comfortable with that yeah i still remember some topics there are c form words and all that a lot of thinking okay okay so like oral discussion completed with this three topics and then he screened he he went to a resume and there were i mentioned two projects one was the research paper i did in the university and one was another 12 month internship so we like deep down into those things that okay why and what have you done like every project and every detail after this completed he started with the coding question and the first question and coding question comes he first started like okay how many data structures you are known of then i said him all the data structures like link my hash keys and all those so he said okay okay so the first question he gave me was like it was damn simple he said to just reverse everything and i thought what is this question why is he asking then i realized he just asked this question to make me comfortable because i have to code it there also right okay so the first question got weird and then he directly jumped to the graphs okay he asked me that explain the difference between dfs and bfs and when i explained him but he also wanted to pseudocode from me so okay like open your notepad and write the pseudocode what's the difference how is the recursion happening in bfs in dfs and how is the iterative method going in bfs so these were the two questions yeah and that's all he got this round cleared he was like pretty impressive because my first coding language was java i do all the code in java he was like okay that's impressive because in industry we use java more as his thing so our third round got cleared with the technical interview and then the fourth round came with this hr on and that was like just two to three minutes around that hr called me and he just said are you like willing to reallocate there's no thing i was comfortable with that i just said yes and he was like okay he was like cutting the call literally i prolonged the conversation with this thing that okay how are you feeling in this company i am a pressure i'm just curious to know what's your experience and he was like he explained the whole journey in like super fast english in just 10 to 15 seconds and see shit then okay okay we create utopi and then we had this thing and after a day i got the final result that i am selecting in brilliant that's great that's good okay so i want to ask you something actually the first very way around that had you know the coding questions and all what would you rate the difficulty level of that away it was medium not hard okay and then coming to the second round wherein you have the gd and all was that easy medium or hard that was not hard since it was like the first time for me and i was very like feared when you say but after giving it i realized that you just have to speak you were given a chance and you just have to speak anything you know they were just testing that you have speaking skills or not that's all so it was like medium you can see medium it's there you just have to speak that's all moving forward when you talk about the third round wherein you were asked the technical questions again a little bit of computer networks as well was that easy medium or hard like i will rate it between medium and hard not hard okay you are like well aware of the topic because they actually gave me the task to run the joint query right i'm not satisfied with the answer so like he was satisfied but he still wants to check if i actually run those queries or not correct and regarding the another thing which was that oops right and he like very deep down into this oops concept he asked before when i explained him then he asked me that can you do something in the code i still remember that question he asked me to explain this one compile time polymorphism yeah that was the question so i explained him with a example of a pseudo code right and what he did he did some manipulation in my code only and then he said that can you apply compile time polymorphism now in this code and actually he was triggering the runtime polymorphism now so it was like you are given an example he did some manipulation in your code and asked that okay what next will happen so that's why i said that it was above medium level okay and finally the HR round i guess was easy uh no question as i just said are you willing to reallocate nothing else okay so as a whole if i ask you to you know tell our watching people you know tell the people who are watching or our juniors coming up any tips to be good at clearing interviews or getting in a company like really what would be your tip and trick for that like i'll be sharing a couple of points first point will be our key be clear in your this csc fundamentals topics that into the four topics and be good in coding because then only you can qualify the way around it never matters like how much you have experience in development you can show that off in interview but the first round will itself be away and if you're not able to qualify then how are you going to tell the interview that i have done this this and all of that all those things right so just yeah be clear in this five topics and i think you will be good to go that's great thank you so much akshay for helping us out with this interview experience it was really nice again guys if you want to read this interview experience as an article i'll put the link in the description below you can always go and have a look at it and i really thank akshay for coming up and guiding us out i hope the people watching this would be really helped out with this interview experience and they take it in handy so i wish to shoot another video with you pretty soon akshay thank you so much for coming out thank you thank you so much for watching guys if you've not liked the video hit the like button and subscribe to coding ninjas i'll see you in the next one happy coding
2,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Qf-dujmboZ4,Welcome to Brillio!,"Brilio, I think, has become from an idea five years ago to a compelling force in the industry, well-known brand, and a significant partner for many of our customers. To simplify, I think, the description of our journey, I probably will use three Cs. The first one is customer-centric culture. We don't exist for technology, but we exist for driving the impact on our customers' businesses. And to enable that culture, I think we have not only invested in making sure that we operationalize our behaviors, but we have invested in technology. So, for example, Codex is a system that we use to capture customer issues as they occur in real time. We use AI to decipher if there are issues that are developing in projects and develop a very fast response system around that. The second C is capability. And these four superpowers are transforming the opportunity for the enterprise, and all of our capabilities have to be around these. And the last C is really around credibility at scale. It's not one, two customers. Brulio has over 100 customers today. They are not throwing small problems at us. They are throwing large problems at us. For example, Ford Motor Company, as they start thinking about how do you reimagine their dealership systems. Forrester recently put us in the leaders' quadrant in their mid-market assessment for Agile service providers. Within the four years of our existence, Brulio was able to attract, from a line of, frankly, top-notch investors, Bain Capital as the primary sponsor, as the investor inside the company. Things that we do really, really well, product engineering or analytics, the kind of work that we do there, or in cloud, digital front office. I think those are the areas where we already have tens of case studies, tens of examples, and we continue to scale that really well. The second horizon is things that we are starting to do really well, but yet to scale. So like artificial intelligence. This is where we have a significant amount of capability. We have done a bunch of work, but now we want to scale to hundreds of millions of dollars of business. Now, similarly, the third horizon, which is emerging for us, is like blockchain. So in case of blockchain, I think we are still working with our customers and defining some use cases and driving the impact, looking at the value engineering, et cetera, et cetera. We are born digital. We know nothing else. So we brought the technology and coupled that with our design thinking capability to start thinking about new journeys for our customers, and therefore new products are developed like that. So therefore, our people are trained. Our people are trained in driving that impact for our customers only. And what it does, it brings a fresh capability at speed for our customers. They actually can sense that our people are able to understand their problems better, are able to respond better. Our scale of digital is larger than many billion dollar companies. So therefore, our focus on method and not just the tool and processes, when I say method, it's about how do you bring all of these capabilities together. So we have something called BrilioOne. BrilioOne is a methodology that brings multiple different disciplines together to drive impact on our customers. Heading to a place where we are going to be one of the largest digital technology services providers, about half a billion dollars in revenue, hoping to drive that in the next three to five years. With Bain as our partner now, I think it makes it more meaningful, more aggressive that we can move forward."
